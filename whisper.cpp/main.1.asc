[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mwhisperfile  [22mis  a  high-performance implementation of OpenAI's Whisper
       model that's based off  the  whisper.cpp  software  written  by  Georgi
       Gerganov,  et  al.   It's  able  to convert speech to text. It can also
       translate different languages into English while transcribing.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       The following options are available:

       [1m--version[0m

               Path   of   Whisper   model   weights.   See   https://hugging‚Äê

       [1m-f [4m[22mFNAME[24m, [1m--file [4m[22mFNAME[0m
               Path of audio file to transcribe. The preferred audio format is
               a  16khz  16-bit signed linear WAV file, which can be stereo or
               mono. It's also permissible to pass an MP3, FLAC, or OGG  file,
               in  which case it'll be converted to .wav file in your temp di‚Äê
               rectory before transcribing.

       [1m-tr[22m, [1m--translate[0m
               Translate audio into English text.

       [1m-ot [4m[22mN[24m, [1m--offset-t [4m[22mN[0m
               Time offset in milliseconds.

       [1m-d [4m[22mN[24m, [1m--duration [4m[22mN[0m
               Duration of audio to process in milliseconds.

       [1m-np[22m, [1m--no-prints[0m
               Do not print anything other than the results.

       [1m-pc[22m, [1m--print-colors[0m
               Enables CLI printing of ANSI color codes.

               Transcribed text will appear in the terminal on a  spectrum  of
               color  ranging  from  green to red. Green represents confidence
               whereas red represents uncertainty.

       [1m-t [4m[22mN[24m, [1m--threads [4m[22mN[0m
               Overrides number of threads to use.

               The default is the number of cores  available  on  the  current
               system.  On systems with hyperthreading, that's half the number
               of CPUs reported by the system. On systems that have efficiency
               cores, e.g. Intel Alderlake, the default  behavior  is  to  use
               only the performance cores.
